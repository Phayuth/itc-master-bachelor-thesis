	In the project:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A* path planning generate pathway using low computational time because the cost function has the heuristic value $H$ as long as its value is not overestimated
		\item The backsteppig controller results controlled output close to the generated pathway
		\item EKF give an accurate pose estimation
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	Contribution : Extended use of ROS package from this project.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The controller can be further developed or switched
		\item Add or Switch sensors that have suit algorithm
		\item Others can use the package to test, simulate, and visualize the robot in the simulated environment.
		\item Real world implementation as this package has topic ready for data publication.
	\end{itemize}

	In the future work, the project will be implemented in hardware.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Improve accuracy and performance
		\item Investigate with hardware capability such as computational speed, data publishing rate, sensor noise, interference, unexpected failure -etc
		\item Disturbance properties -etc.
	\end{itemize}
