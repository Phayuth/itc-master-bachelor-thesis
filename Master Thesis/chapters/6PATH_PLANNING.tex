\hspace{1.27cm}
Robotic operating system (ROS) is an open source framework developed for robotic purposes. It contains libraries and packages that are already built and ready to use for robots. ROS is a peer-to-peer network of processes that could run on multiple devices that are connected via network.(\cite{rosabout})\par
\hspace{1.27cm}
\textbf{\figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:ROS Framework}}}, ROS center of communication is ROS Master. ROS master acts as a keeper of topics and services, registration and information of ROS nodes. ROS nodes are the process of performing the computation. It publishes or subscribes ROS messages with other nodes via ROS topics. ROS message is a data that has been simplified into a structure.\par

\subsubsection{Odometry Message}
\hspace{1.27cm}
Odometry is the information of robot position and velocity within the environment. In 3D coordinate system, the robot position is represented as \([p_x\quad p_y\quad p_z]^T\) and the orientation of the robot is represented as roll, pitch, yaw in Euler angle representation. As our robot is in 2D planar motion, thus we only interested in \([p_x\quad p_y\quad \theta]^T\). When using the ROS message, the odometry directly publishes with the position and orientation of the robot from the simulated environment. The position is expressed as \([p_x\quad p_y]\) and the orientation in the quaternion form \((qw,qx,qy,qz)\).\par

In this project the Odometry Message is used to contain the data of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lidar scan matching
	\item Wheel encoder odometry
	\item EKF fusion pose
	\item Robot true pose
	\item Robot current pose

\hspace{1.27cm}
IMU is a module that consists of three different types of sensors (triaxial). Those sensors are accelerometer, gyroscopes, and magnetometer, which measure the acceleration, the angular velocity, and the magnetic field, respectively. The IMU ROS message are used to show the data of velocity, acceleration, and orientation of a system in quaternion form.\par

\subsubsection{Twist Message}
\hspace{1.27cm}
In ROS, twist is the message that carries the information of the velocity of the system in free space. The velocity of the system is decomposed into linear velocity and angular velocity. Furthermore the Twist message is used to publish the message for the mobile robot controller.\par

\subsubsection{LIDAR Message}
\hspace{1.27cm}
Lidar is a remote sensing device that uses light pulses to detect the distance from an object and has been widely used for multipurposes including navigation and mapping. Lidar usually contains a laser scanner and DC motor. The DC motor rotates the laser scanner in a 360 degree circle to obtain a full 360 degrees of the environment. \textbf{\tableautorefname{ \ref{Table: Lidar Properties}}}\par
\hspace{1.27cm}
In the project, the Lidar data is used to create the occupancy grid map and robot localization in the sensor fusion section. Using the Scan Matching algorithm, the robot pose is measured and update in the EKF fusion.\par

\end{figure}
\hspace{1.27cm}
\textbf{\figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:Gazebo and Rviz Window}}}, the Gazebo robot simulation software will be used to simulate the robot, sensor and the surrounding environment. The RVIZ is used as a visualization tool. RVIZ allows us to visualize and verify the incoming data from the ROS messages. In this project, RVIZ is used to visualize the Occupancy Grid Map, Robot Model, Robot trajectory -etc.\par












\subsection{Path Planning A*}
\hspace{1.27cm}
A* algorithm is one of the path search algorithm that is widely used in many fields. In the mobile robotic field, the algorithm is used for searching the path in a robot navigation task. In this project, the A* algorithm is used to search the path for the mobile robot. The information that is given to the algorithm are the start point (robot current position), goal point (desired point to move to), and the occupancy grid map (which contain the free space and the occupied space of the environment).





















\subsubsection{Occupancy Grid Map}
\hspace{1.27cm}
Occupancy grid map is one of many pieces of information that are required for the mobile robot for navigation tasks such as path planning, navigation, environment map, and localization.\par
\hspace{1.27cm}
Occupancy grid map represents the environment in square grid cells. Each of grid cells is represented as either an occupied cell or a free cell according to the calculation of the binary probability value. \textbf{\figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:Occupancy Grid Map}}}, Occupancy Grid Map is a 2D map is a large set that contains a probability value in every cell. The cell representation as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Occupied cell} by probability value of (1) with black color
	\item \textbf{Free cell} by a probability value of (0) with white color
\end{itemize}
With the assumption of that the cell is either occupied or free, each probability value contained in each cell are independent, and the surrounding environment is static. Occupancy grid maps are fine-grained grids defined over the continuous space of locations and often used after solving the SLAM problem by some other means and taking the resulting path estimates for granted. \textbf{\tableautorefname{ \ref{Table: Occupancy Grid Map Properties}}} is ROS properties of Occupancy Grid Map.\par

\textbf{\figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:Occupancy Grid Map Cell Value}}}, SLAM start with the initialization of an empty cell grid. Each cell has an address in the grid and its size is determined by the algorithm or user assign value. Then, the empty grid is filled with probability value to represent the obstacle in the environment where the robot can not traverse on.\par

\subsubsection{A* Algorithm}
\hspace{1.27cm}
A* algorithm is an algorithm that based on the heuristic method. A* is the optimal best-first search algorithm. A* calculates the travel cost to the neighbor node from the current node. Node with the lowest cost to travel to is chosen.\par
The cost function is:
\begin{equation}
F(n)=G(n)+H(n)
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\makebox[1cm]{\(F(n)\)\hfill} is the total cost of node path}
	\item {\makebox[1cm]{\(G(n)\)\hfill} is the exact distance from the starting node to the current node}
	\item {\makebox[1cm]{\(H(n)\)\hfill} is the estimation distance from the current node to the ending node}
	\item {\makebox[1cm]{\(n\)\hfill} is the node}

%	\item \(F(n)\) is the total cost of node path
%	\item \(G(n)\) is the exact distance from the starting node to the current node
%	\item \(H(n)\) is the estimation distance from the current node to the ending node. (Heuristic part of the cost function, meaning it is a guess)
%	\item \(n\) is the node
\end{itemize}

\hspace{1.27cm}
From SLAM, we obtain the occupancy grid like in figure shown below. \textbf{\figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:Occupancy Grid Map Example}}}, Each cell in the grid have its own address and the occupied value depending on SLAM. Let the origin address of the grid be in the top left corner, same as the occupancy grid map SLAM.\par

\hspace{1.27cm}
\textbf{\figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:Astar starting point and ending point}}}, The white cell represents the space where the robot can move and the black cell represents the space where the robot can not move. Which mean, the starting point and the ending point have to be on chosen on the white cell address.\par

\hspace{1.27cm}
In \textbf{\figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:Euclidean Distance of G value}}}, to calculate the value of \(G(n)\) the exact distance from the starting point to the current node, we can use the Euclidean distance formula:\par

%	\item \(x_a\) and \(x_b\) is the cell address of a and b in x-axis

$\bullet$ \textbf{$H(n)$ value}\par
\hspace{1.27cm}
In \textbf{\figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:Euclidean Distance of H value}}}, to calculate the value of \(H(n)\) the estimation distance from the current node to the ending node, we can use the Euclidean distance formula same as the \ref{eq:PP_euclidean_dis}. The value \(H(n)\) is the Heuristic part of the cost function, meaning it can be a guess value. Thus, in coding the square root can be dropped for the performance optimization.\par

$\bullet$ \textbf{Initialize} \par
\hspace{1.27cm}
At start, the current node state is set to the start cell. The $H(n)$ and $G(n)$ of the cell is calculated using the \ref{eq:PP_euclidean_dis}. The $F(n)$ is the sum of the $G(n)$ and $H(n)$ \textbf{\figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:Start Point F,G,H}}}. Create 2 lists: Open list and Closed List.\par

\begin{itemize}
	\item Open List contains the cell which the cost value is yet to be calculated or traversed pass.
	\item Closed List contains the cell which the cost value is calculated or traversed pass or block by the obstacle.
\end{itemize}

Starting by adding the start cell to the Open List. After calculate the cost value, move it to the Closed List.

This action is loop until the goal point is found (the goal point is added to the Closed List). Then, backtracking the path from the goal to start as shown in \textbf{\figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:Current state transition}}}.\par
