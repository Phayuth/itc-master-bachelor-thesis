Wheeled mobile robotic path planning is one of the main problem that robotic community currently working on. Path planning allow the robot to navigation in surrounding environment from point A to point B while avoiding the obstacle such as wall, furniture, human, etc. In order to plan the path that it needed to take in the environment, the robot need a great quantity of information of its surrounding and algorithm that will determine the optimal path for the navigation. This thesis present the algorithm for the robot the plan the path from its initial coordinate to desired coordinate by observe the information coming from multiple sensor such as Camera, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Rotary Wheel Encoder, as well as Occupancy Grid Map that is obtained by Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).\par
